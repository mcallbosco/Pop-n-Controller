# Pop-n-Controller
THIS IS NOT READY. This repo focuses on the construction of a pop'n controller using a 3d printer and laser cutter. A remix of https://github.com/charcole/Dreamcast-PopnMusic

# Why did I make this
I didn't want to laser cut all the wood that charcole's project required (Especially since the size was too large for my cutter). I did however want a controller with curves. Unfortunetly, it was harder than I thought but now we are here.

# Required things for a pop'n controller of any type.
9 100mm Buttons
    1 Red
    2 Blue
    2 Green
    2 Yellow
    2 White
A Microcontroller
    I recomend the Aurduino Leonardo. It's cheap, easy to use and since our controller doesn't have additional LEDS, it's perfect for use with this controller. I would recomend using https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/UltimatePopnController as the firmware. 
Wire
    I personally used arcade switch wires for the switches, and soldered on the wires for the lights since I didn't have any of those.

# Things required for this project
Access to a laser cutter
    This is required for the top bit. This could be modified to use 3D printed parts that are segmented, and now that I think about that I probably should add that as an option. But for now, you need a laser cut top part. The top should be made out of a sturdy material, but I got by with 1/8th inch thick ultility board. 
Access to a larger 3D printer.
    I used a neptune 4 plus, and some things hardly managed to fit on the plate. 
That's it
    We will be printing our own bolts/nuts to use, this may seem like a bad idea but it's worked well for my builds of this project. If you want to, you could change the height of the walls and make it compatable with metal bolts/nuts you can get on ebay. This project uses M8 spec nuts and bolts.
