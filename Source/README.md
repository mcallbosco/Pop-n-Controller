Congrats, you want to build upon or modify this project to make it better. Here's a few things you should know.

# Sorry about the mess. This code is very messy, but hopefully most of the things you want to change are avalible as paramaters.
# This code is also extremly unoptimized. Usage of the OpenSCAD nightly is basically required. Enable Manifold. 

# Wall Thickness
# Due to the way I imported the walls, the walls are not 1 to 1 and not evenly thick on all parts. Sorry about this.

# Height Changes
# The bolts should automatically be compensated when you change the height, but I would recomend printing a test one to make sure before going all out.
