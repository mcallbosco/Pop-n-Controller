Congrats on getting here. This is what you need to print/make

Laser Cutter:
PopnMusicTop.dxf #If you are using the default files, I would recomend making this with 1/8th inch thick material. If you change this, you need to change the length of the bolt. In my builds, I use wood. 

3D Printer: #Fair warning, you will need a big printer. I used a Neputne 4 Plus.
# Please note that these models expect you to have a printer that can print wiht a Tolerance of .1 mm. If your printer can't do that, you will need to re-export these files. 
Wall1.stl   x1
Wall2.stl   x1
Wall3.stl   x1
Bottom.stl  x1 #You will need to cut this, and depending on your printer size print it vertically. In my experince for some reason when I cut this it increases the length twords the center, so you may need to use a table saw to slightly cut this part.  
NutBolt.stl x8 




## Side Notes
I have made a diffrent version of PopnMusicTop.dfx that features the mesurements from (https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/PopnPanel). Besides being more arcade accurate, that also makes this compatible with his graphics.
